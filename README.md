# TCS NQT Coding Questions Solutions in C++

This repository contains solutions to the TCS NQT Coding Questions compiled from the [TCS NQT Coding Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/tcs-nqt-coding-sheet-tcs-coding-questions). The problems are solved using **C++**, providing clean, efficient, and well-documented code for each question.

## Structure of the Repository

Each question is solved in a separate file for better organization. The file naming convention follows:

```
Q<number>_<short_problem_name>.cpp
```

For example:
- `Q01_array_manipulation.cpp`
- `Q02_binary_conversion.cpp`

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired question file and review the solution.
3. Compile and run the C++ files using your preferred compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ Q01_array_manipulation.cpp -o Q01_array_manipulation
   ./Q01_array_manipulation
   ```


## Contribution
